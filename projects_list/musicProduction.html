   <p><h1>Music Production</h1></p> 
   <p>I have recently started dabbling in music production using FL studios, often with friends from software engineering. I have a few mixes and songs posted on soudcloud and hope to put more
    of my music out for other people to hear. I have always had a passion for music, but gotten more into electronic music as my music taste evolved. My favourite music genres these days are drum and bass (UK, lo-fi, Jungle),
     Garage and Electronica. I have also started recently become quite fond of more niche genres like girly drum and bass,
     girly trap and hardcore grime acapella on top of a jolly house or garage beat.
