    <p><h1>Front end programming for indo hf</h1></p>
    <p>Indo is a ...</p>
    <p>During my time working for indo I gained experience in programming with Flutter, which was used to develop the front end of their application.
        Since I was new to the programming using Flutter, my first tasks revolved around all sorts of bug fixes in order to learn to navigate through the 
        application and learn the basics. As my knowledge grew deeper I was trusted with larger tasks, and the most important feature I was trusted with was the currency converter, which I also 
        got to design using Figm. It uses a backend API that regularly updates each currency, which is sourced from 
        <a href="https://enfuce.com/">Enfuce</a>. The converter has a larger selection of curencies than any other icelandic bank app, and prioritizes most recently 
        used currencies to optimize the client experience.
