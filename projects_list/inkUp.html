    inkUp is a startup idea that was born when I took an entrepreneurially focused course in the University of Iceland.
    It is a platform that connects tattoo artists to potential customers in order to make the tattoo industry less underground than it is.
    The idea was born when me and my friends were going on a trip to Berlin and wanted to get tattoos, but had nowhere to look since we didnt 
    know anyone that could advise us on where to look. That is when I thought that having a platform that connects where clients can get an overview
    on all artists and their portfolios in their nearby area would benefit both parties. Artists would get more exposure and clients would have easier access
    to the art they wish for, since getting a tattoo is a lifelong decision.

In the course I took in Iceland I made a business model for inkUp along with a business pitch that was pitched to 
investors and important people in the tech industry. I then took another similar course in Madrid when I re-iterated the business model and pitch, 
after getting artists and clients to take a number of surveys in order to get more in depth knowledge on inkUp's target market.
I also designed the whole front end logic for the application using <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GfvqcwaPWDfIIeFbpFnztH/InkUp?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=J6hbyZs2IEmJRH1z-1">Figma</a> and using a mock database, implemented a mock version of the application using Adalo, which is accesible <a href="https://previewer.adalo.com/11a6897d-d71b-4c3f-9c08-7f6d59bc061b">here</a>.
