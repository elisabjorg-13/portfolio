                            Placing a pikkoló station near a big workplace is favourable.</p>

                        <h1>Motivation</h1>
                        <p> Pikkoló strives for a more sustainable future in grocery shopping
                            by letting users pick up grocery orders in stations located near them, thus minimizing air
                            pollution and encouraging users to be less
                            dependent on daily car travels.
                            Me and another student were approached by a professor who was at the time teaching us
                            machine learning and operational programming and given the opportunity to
                            implement a visual solution for pikkoló, calculating where to situate their pick up
                            stations.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Method</h2>
                        <p>Linear regression was performed on data we found appropriate for the project, sourced from
                            the geographic information system of Reykjavik and the GPS system TomTom. Data analization
                            and Linear Regression was
                            performed using R and mapped onto a map of Reykjavik, creating a simple and understandeable
                            solution that Pikkoló uses for potential business opportunities.</p>

                    <div class="abt-block-3">
                        <h2>Outcome</strong></h2>
                        <p>Different maps were created, each mapping a different regression based on premises. The
                            intention
                            of doing so was that Pikkoló could have a
                            more in depth backlog of maps that looked at the problem from different points of views. The
                            maps show different neighbourhoods of the city where the more light the blue colour, the
                            higher
                            the liklelyhood of opening a pikkoló station.
                            The red dots are locations of supermarkets in Reykjavík.</p>
