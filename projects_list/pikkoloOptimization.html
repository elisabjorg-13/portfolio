    <p><h1>Pikkoló optimization</h1></p>
    <p>Summer 2022 i worked for the startup pikkoló, that strives for a more sustainable future in grocery shopping 
        by letting users pick up grocery orders in stations located near them, thus minimizing air pollution and encouraging users to be less 
        dependent on daily car travels. 
        Me and another student were approached by a professor who was at the time teaching us machine learning and operational programming and given the opportunity to 
        implement a visual solution for pikkoló, calculating where to situate their pick up stations. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Method</strong></p>
    <p>We implemented linear regression on the data we found appropriate for the project, which was sourced from the geographic information system of Reykjavik and the GPS system TomTom. The data analization and Linear Regression was 
        performed using R and then mapped onto a map of Reykjavik, creating a simple and understandeable solution that pikkoló could use for potential business opportunities.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>In the end, four different maps were created, each mapping a different regression based on different premises. We decided to make a few so that pikkoló could have a 
        more in depth backlog of maps that looked at the problem from different points of views. The maps show different neighbourhoods of the city where the more light the blue colour, the higher the liklelyhood of opening a pikkoló station. 
    The red dots are locations of supermarkets in Reykjavík. Following are the two main maps implemented</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
           <p><strong>1. Solution </strong></p> 
           <ul>
            <li><p>Likelyhood of placing pikkoló station based on population and traffic in 500m distance from supermarket</p>
            </li>

            </li>
           </ul>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>2. Solution</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>This solution uses population and traffic near each neighbourhood and also takes in the center of gravity of the surface area of private properties (green dot), such as workplaces.
                    Placing a pikkoló station near a big workplace is favourable.</p></li>
