    <h1><strong>About me </strong></h1>
    <p>Hi I'm Elísa Björg </p>
    <p>I am a programmer from Iceland. I graduated from my bachelors in software engineering from University of 
        Iceland in June 2023, after taking my last semester abroad in Madrid at Universidad Pontificia Comillas. </p>

    <p>During my time studying my degree, it quickly became clear that my interests were more in the creative and artistic side of 
        computer industry . I found myself drawn to front end design and programming, both for websites and mobile applications for companies I worked for during the summer.  
        Furthermore, I gained a lot of interest in data analization and visualisation after implementing a visual solution for a startup last summer. 
        I feel that presenting data based knowledge in a way that anybody understands, regardless of education or background, is one of the 
        key things for the future. During my time in the University of Iceland, I was a Teaching assistand in Database Theory for professor
        Snorri Agnarsson, where I taught so called "excersize classes" and revised homework. 
    </p>
    <p> I have always had a passion for music and through programming i started getting into music production using FL studios, where a few of my songs
        and mixes are available on my soundcloud. Music production is a good way for me to combine my creative and nerdy side and me and a fellow programmer friend 
        regularly produce together. 
    </p>
    <p>Last but not least, I discovered I had a knack for the entrepreneurial side of the software industry. My startup idea
        called inkUp is a platform that strives to connect tattoo artists and possible clients, with its goal to make the tattoo industry
        less underground, benifitting both the seller and the buyer. Whilst in University, I got the chance to practice pitching my idea in front 
        of investors and powerful people in Iceland´s tech industry. Whilst I got good feedback on the idea, what they told me was even 
        better was my ability to stand in front of many people and present my ideas and arguments in a convincing way. 
    </p>
    <p> I feel that my strength comes from my blend of creative and academic thinking, along with my ability to talki in fron of people </p>
